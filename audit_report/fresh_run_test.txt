 STEP 5 — Clean Build Reproducibility Check
============================================================

1. Fresh workspace (no prior state)
  [PASS] no state file initially
  [PASS] default state on fresh
  [PASS] default state chunks empty

2. Mock pipeline run
  [PASS] pipeline did not crash
  [PASS] engine called feature_extraction
  [PASS] engine called matching
  [PASS] engine called sparse
  [PASS] engine called dense
  [PASS] state file cleaned after complete
  [PASS] got 'start' event
  [PASS] got 'complete' event
  [PASS] no 'error' event

3. Idempotent re-run
  [PASS] second run calls engine again (state was reset) — calls: ['feature_extraction', 'matching', 'sparse', 'dense']

============================================================
 TOTAL: 13 PASS, 0 FAIL
